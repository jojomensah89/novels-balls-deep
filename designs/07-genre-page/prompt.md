# Genre Page Design Prompt

## Overview

Design a genre-specific landing page (e.g., /novels/genre/fantasy). Similar to browse page but focused on a single genre with curated content.

## Page Layout

### 1. Genre Header

- **Background**: Large banner with gradient in genre's signature color
- **Title**: Genre name in large text (e.g., "Fantasy Novels")
- **Icon**: Optional genre icon
- **Description**: 1-2 line description of the genre
- **Stats**: "1,234 novels" count

### 2. Featured in Genre

- **Section**: Top 3-5 novels in horizontal feature cards
- **Card Style**: Larger than normal, with extended description
- **Label**: "Editor's Picks" or "Top Fantasy"

### 3. Novel Grid

- Same as browse page grid
- Pre-filtered to this genre
- Additional filters still available (status, sort)

### 4. Related Genres

- **Section**: "You might also like"
- **Pills/Cards**: Link to related genres
- Fantasy → Adventure, Magic, Isekai, etc.
